# Implementation Plan: deployment_cicd

## Phase 1: GitHub Actions CI Pipeline [checkpoint: be8d394]
- [x] Task: Setup GitHub Actions workflow for backend tests [f027e92]
    - [ ] Write Tests: Ensure backend tests run successfully locally.
    - [ ] Implement Feature: Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and configure Python environment and pytest to run on push/PR to main.
- [x] Task: Expand CI Pipeline for frontend tests [ed0e7f0]
    - [ ] Write Tests: Ensure frontend tests run successfully locally with `CI=true`.
    - [ ] Implement Feature: Update `ci.yml` to include Node.js environment and frontend test execution.
- [x] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 1: GitHub Actions CI Pipeline' (Protocol in workflow.md) [be8d394]

## Phase 2: Docker Containerization
- [x] Task: Create Nginx Configuration [858ccb7]
    - [ ] Write Tests: Verify proxy behavior locally if possible.
    - [ ] Implement Feature: Create `nginx.conf` to serve static frontend files on port 80 and proxy `/api` and WebSocket traffic to the backend.
- [x] Task: Create Start Script for Container [7fdc090]
    - [ ] Write Tests: Test script execution.
    - [ ] Implement Feature: Create a `start.sh` script to launch both Uvicorn (backend) and Nginx within the single container.
- [ ] Task: Create Multi-stage Dockerfile
    - [ ] Write Tests: Verify the image builds successfully.
    - [ ] Implement Feature: Create `Dockerfile` at the root with a Node build stage for the frontend, and a Python production stage containing Nginx, backend code, and built frontend assets.
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 2: Docker Containerization' (Protocol in workflow.md)

## Phase 3: Documentation and Final Verification
- [ ] Task: Document Deployment and Networking
    - [ ] Write Tests: N/A
    - [ ] Implement Feature: Update `README.md` with instructions on how to build the Docker image and run it with port 2323 mapped (`-p 2323:80`).
- [ ] Task: Conductor - User Manual Verification 'Phase 3: Documentation and Final Verification' (Protocol in workflow.md)
